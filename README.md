## What It Does

PhantomEye downloads threat intelligence from 8 free public feeds and checks your Windows network activity against them in real time.

It detects:
- Machines connecting to known **malware / C2 servers** (both allowed and blocked connections)
- **Inbound connection attempts** from known malicious IPs
- DNS lookups for known **phishing or malware domains**
- Malicious IPs or domains in **email headers**
- Any IP or domain you want to **manually check**

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔍 IP / Domain Lookup | Instant verdict from 40,000+ IOCs — paste any IP, domain, or full URL |
| 📧 Email Header Analyser | Paste raw Outlook headers — extracts and checks all relay IPs and sender domains |
| 🔥 Firewall Log Scanner | Checks Windows Firewall log — flags both outbound (dst) and inbound (src) malicious IPs |
| 🌐 DNS Cache Scanner | Checks your Windows DNS resolver cache for malicious domains |
| 📊 Alert History | Full timestamped alert log with CSV export |
| 📡 Feed Status | Per-feed IOC count, last-update timestamp, and health indicator |
| 🩺 Health Check | `--check` flag validates config, DB, and feed status from the CLI |

---

## Threat Feeds (all free, no account needed)

| Feed | Type | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Feodo Tracker | IP | Botnet C2 servers |
| Emerging Threats | IP | Compromised hosts |
| CINS Score | IP | Known bad actors |
| Abuse.ch SSL Blacklist | IP | Malicious SSL certificates |
| URLhaus | Domain | Malware download URLs |
| OpenPhish | Domain | Active phishing sites |
| Botvrij.eu | Domain | Malicious domains |
| Botvrij.eu | IP | Malicious IPs |

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.10 or newer — [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Internet connection for feed updates
- **No extra packages needed** — runs entirely on Python's standard library

---

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open `config.py` and set `ADMIN_PC` to your admin machine name
3. Right-click `Install_PhantomEye.bat` → **Run as administrator**
4. Done — PhantomEye launches automatically and feeds are downloaded

The installer creates two Windows Scheduled Tasks:
- **Feed update** — every 6 hours
- **Morning scan** — daily at 6:00 AM

Both run as your user account, not SYSTEM.

---

## Usage

**Launch the GUI:**
```
python C:\SecurityLogs\PhantomEye\main.py --gui
```

**Update feeds only:**
```
python C:\SecurityLogs\PhantomEye\main.py --update-feeds
```

**Run a scan headlessly (for scripting):**
```
python C:\SecurityLogs\PhantomEye\main.py --scan
```

**Quick lookup from terminal:**
```
python C:\SecurityLogs\PhantomEye\main.py --lookup 185.234.xx.xx
python C:\SecurityLogs\PhantomEye\main.py --lookup evil-domain.ru
```

**Check version:**
```
python C:\SecurityLogs\PhantomEye\main.py --version
```

**Validate config and feed health:**
```
python C:\SecurityLogs\PhantomEye\main.py --check
```

---

## Email Alerts (optional)

Set `EMAIL_ENABLED = True` in `config.py`.

Store your password as a Windows environment variable — **never hardcode it**:
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
  'PHANTOMEYE_EMAIL_PASSWORD', 'your_app_password', 'Machine')
```

---

## Running Tests

PhantomEye ships with 86 unit tests covering utils, feeds, lookup, and alerts.

```
pip install pytest
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Enabling Windows Firewall Logging

For the firewall scan to work:

1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**
2. Click **Windows Defender Firewall Properties**
3. On each profile tab (Domain, Private, Public):
   - Logging → Customize
   - Log successful connections: **Yes**
   - Log dropped packets: **Yes**
4. Click OK

---

## Disclaimer

PhantomEye is a **known-bad detector** — it matches against public threat intelligence feeds which typically lag 24–72 hours behind novel attacks. It is not a replacement for a full EDR or managed security service. It is designed to raise the security floor for small businesses that currently have no automated threat monitoring.

## Changelog

**v1.2** *(current)*
- Fixed: IPv6 validation rewritten with stdlib `ipaddress` module — handles every RFC edge case correctly
- Fixed: `messagebox` calls moved off background threads (prevented random GUI crashes)
- Fixed: `init_database` / `load_ioc_cache` no longer called twice on `--gui` path
- Fixed: Empty lookup query now returns explicit error instead of false "Clean" verdict
- Fixed: SMTP now uses `ssl.create_default_context()` — server certificate is verified
- Fixed: Email IP extraction restricted to `Received:` headers only — eliminates false positives
- Fixed: Firewall scanner now checks source IP — inbound attacks from known bad actors detected
- Fixed: Double whitelist check in feed parser removed
- Fixed: All `except: pass` replaced with proper `log.warning` / `log.error` calls
- New: `_meta_cache` in `feeds.py` — zero extra DB connections per lookup
- New: `--version` CLI flag
- New: `--check` CLI flag — validates config, DB connectivity, and feed health
- New: Feed health warning card on Dashboard turns red when any feed has failed
- New: Last Scan time stat card on Dashboard
- New: `ALERT_HISTORY_LIMIT` moved to `config.py` (was hardcoded 500)
- New: 86 unit tests across `utils`, `feeds`, `lookup`, `alerts` — run with `pytest tests/`
- New: `requirements.txt` documents Python 3.10+ requirement and dev dependencies
- Improved: `is_private_ip` now correctly catches multicast, reserved, and unspecified ranges
- Improved: `parse_feed` builds a set directly — no list→set round-trip

**v1.1**
- Refactored into 14 modules (was a 1,512-line single file)
- Fixed: Lookup and email analysis now run in background threads
- Fixed: Firewall scanner checks ALLOW *and* DROP entries
- Fixed: Alert deduplication — same IOC won't re-alert within 24h
- Fixed: Per-alert DB connection overhead eliminated
- Fixed: Variable shadowing in DNS scanner
- Fixed: Zero-feeds warning on lookup when DB is empty
- Fixed: Email password from environment variable
- Fixed: IPv6 validation and checking
- Fixed: Full URL auto-stripping in lookup tab
- New: Export alerts to CSV

**v1.0**
- Initial release
